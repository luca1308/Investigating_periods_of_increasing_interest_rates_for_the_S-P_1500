# Investigating periods of increasing interest rates for the S&P 1500
This project aims to investigate periods of increasing interest rates by the federal reserve based on the constituents of the S&P 1500. As an end result we attempt to implement our findings into a portfolio strategy.

The first month of observation is defined as the month of the first hike. The last date of observation is defined as the last month before a decreasing or stagnant interest rate (no change). Company data is based on the latest data available which have been published figures before the first day.

We do not adjust for changes in the SP1500, but will include all the data available for its constituents as of the first month of the respective period. The initial model approaches can be distincted by the choice of data.

There are three distinctions:

"concluded" = using only the data of concluded periods

"ct" = the current, included period is used as the test data in the models

"all" = all data is used and equally treated

The created files can be alloted to the respective distinctions based on the abbreviations above.

## Structure
1. Main directory:
You can find the executed notebook in four formats (ipynb/py/html/pdf) under the name **999786**. The three tables for periods and performance of the final classifier implemented are also available, just as the image files used in the presentation for all the models. The environment necessary to run a kernel and execute the notebook yourself is available as "env.yaml".

2. data_raw/data:
The raw input data for the features in respect to the periods specific constituents as xlsx and Gold futures as csv are available in the data_raw directory. The data directory holds a cleaned intermediate version of the constructed dataframes.

3. trees:
The trees directory holds all the trees that were build during the the execution of the the RandomForestClassifier for each model.

4. Papers:
The papers directory holds the scientific papers that helped build the research question for this project.

Data Source:
All of the data that isn't retrieved while executing the code has been exported from Bloomberg Terminal or investing.com for Gold and is available within the folder "data_raw" in xlsx format. The data which is retrieved during the code execution is retrieved from Yahoo Finance or the FRED API, which is a API provided by the Federal Reserve of St.Lewis (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).

You should be able to run this notebook after creating a local environment using anaconda/miniconda and executing following command while referring to the provided yaml file for your respective machine:

`conda env create --file=env.yaml`
