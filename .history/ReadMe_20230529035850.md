# Investigating periods of increasing interest rates for the S&P 1500
This project aims to investigate periods of increasing interest rates by the federal reserve based on the constituents of the S&P 1500. As an end result we attempt to implement our findings into a portfolio strategy.

The first month of observation is defined as the month of the first hike. The last date of observation is defined as the last month before a decreasing or stagnant interest rate (no change). Company data is based on the latest data available which have been published figures before the first day. 

We do not adjust for changes in the SP1500, but will include all the data available for its constituents as of the first month of the respective period.

All of the data that isn't retrieved while executing the code has been exported from Bloomberg Terminal or investing.com for Gold and is available within the folder "data_raw" in xlsx format. The data which is retrieved during the code execution is retrieved from Yahoo Finance or the FRED API, which is a API provided by the Federal Reserve of St.Lewis (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).

You should be able to run this notebook after creating a local environment using anconda/miniconda and executing following command while referring to the provided yaml file for your respective machine:

`conda env create --file=env.yaml`
