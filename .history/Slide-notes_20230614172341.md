### Title slide
- title explanation, emphasis on "investigating" 

### Slide 8
- initially sp500, but due to bad/no membership data before 2000, limited to short timeframe
- solution is sp1500, as we have the same number of periods

### slide 25

- several more or less influential features
- utilities just as good as an indicator to underperform as to outperform

### slide 26
- P/E most important by far, followed by shape and revenue per employee
- others quite irrelevant

### slide 27
- all features are quite irrelevant in total
- utilities once again ambiguous
- Sharpe, net debt, beta and revenue important

### slide 28
